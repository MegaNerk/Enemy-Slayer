This is an old text-game I wrote which runs in the terminal. I made it some years ago.
I made this for myself in one week, primarily to learn about Maven and other Java related tools.
The code itself is very simplistic and wasn't the point here, but rather the tools used to create it, which at the time I was not familiar with.
Upon starting a run you can damage enemies or regain your own HP, repeating until all enemies are slain. After each run you can spend your gold to upgrade your stats.
